climate_crisis_explainer_1|Let's Stop the Climate Crisis!
climate_crisis_explainer_2|As you probably know, our climate is changing because of greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. We only have about a decade left to drastically reduce emissions if we want to prevent the worst effects, which could include flooding, droughts and major health risks. Here are just a few actions you can take:
climate_crisis_explainer_3|Vote!
climate_crisis_explainer_4|It is very important that governments create laws that help companies and people reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, please vote for a sensible party whenever you can.
climate_crisis_explainer_5|Eat Less Meat
climate_crisis_explainer_6|There are amazing meat alternatives, that taste great and cause far less harmful emissions. Also, beans or nuts can be a good alternative source of protein.
climate_crisis_explainer_7|Don't Fly
climate_crisis_explainer_8|Flying causes a huge amount of CO2 emission. Stay on the ground whenever you can. If you like to travel, taking the train is a great, fun option!
climate_crisis_explainer_9|Be Informed
climate_crisis_explainer_10|Knowledge is power! Read climate news and facts on sites like The Guardian Environment and the Climate Reality Project.

theLostShip.json/BuildIndoorFarmAndHouse.text|You used a space ship to get here. Some of your friends are still on it. You'll want to give them a place to live.

theLostShip.json/BuildIndoorFarmAndHouse.quickText|Build a house and an indoor farm.
theLostShip.json/SpawnMorePeople.text|Good job! Some more people will arrive soon.\nIt could be helpful to learn some more about this world. In particular, the alien ruins look quite interesting. Let's build an exploration center to learn all about them and maybe get some useful resources too.
theLostShip.json/SpawnMorePeople.quickText|Build an exploration center.
theLostShip.json/NowArrivingRegularly.text|New people will now start arriving regularly. Make sure to keep them fed and housed. Also, children can be born from now on. You can build a school for them if you want.[n]\nTo build up your city, you'll need lots of stone, so let's build one more stone mine.

theLostShip.json/StoneMineUpgrade.text|[c]Your stone miners have good equipment thanks to the Better Pickaxes upgrade.

theLostShip.json/Happiness.text|Now that you've got a pretty good economy, it's time to focus on your citizens' wellbeing for a bit. Not that there's no economic advantage to that at all, as happy citizens work faster. To make them more happy, let's build a pub. Also, make sure you have at least 10 food.
theLostShip.json/Happiness.quickText|Build a pub and have at least 10 food.

You may want to build some labs to get more knowledge.
theLostShip.json/BuildStoneTeleporter.quickText|Build a rock teleporter.
theLostShip.json/BuildObservatory.text|Well done! You'll never run out of stone now. Keep your stone mines, as you need those workers to mine the meteroids.\nYour population is growing quickly, and this world is quite small. It's probably a good idea to look for other worlds to colonize, so let's build an observatory.
theLostShip.json/BuildObservatory.quickText|Build the observatory.
theLostShip.json/Win.title|Scenario Complete!

Either way, you can always return to this city later.

multipleWorlds.json/Start.text|Soon after building the observatory, your scientists found a world that looked promising. You decided to fly there and take a look. Apparently, your scientists didn't look very closely, because what they thought to be one world are actually multiple tiny worlds. Still, this looks like a fairly suitable location to build a city.\nTo get started, let's build a woodcutting center, a stone mine, an indoor farm and a house.
multipleWorlds.json/Start.quickText|Build a woodcutting center, a stone mine, an indoor farm and a house.
multipleWorlds.json/MorePeople.text|That's a good start! You've invited some people from your previous city. They'll arrive in the coming days.\nYour citizens don't seem very happy right now. Let's build a pub to cheer them up a bit.
multipleWorlds.json/MorePeople.quickText|Build a pub.

multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorlds.quickText|Connect the currently populated world with another by building landing pads.
multipleWorlds.json/GoToOtherWorldsDone.text|[c]You already built an experimental farm! Well done![/][n]Now that your city has some more space, it'll probably grow rapidly. You'll soon have many more mouths to feed. To make that a bit easier, let's build an experimental farm.[/]

multipleWorlds.json/GoBuildRefinedMetalFactory.text|[c]You already built a refined metals factory! Good job![/][n]To build some types of buildings, raw stone isn't good enough. You'll need to refine it first. Let's build a refined metals factory to do just that.[/]

multipleWorlds.json/GetHighHappiness.text|[c]Wow, I'm impressed!

multipleWorlds.json/GetHighHappiness.quickText|Bring the happiness above 80.
multipleWorlds.json/Win.title|Scenario Complete!
