House
The Basic House is the first basic building with housing for your citizens besides the Modern Rustic Home.

## Strategy

As it is cheap and unlocked from the beginning, the Basic House is essential for the early game. However, it is better to build houses with higher happiness values if you want your citizens to be happy.

The Living Research Center allows you to upgrade all basic homes to a different type, making it much easier to reach maximum home quality.
||
Alien House
The Alien House is a house in The Final Earth 2. It is unlocked by fully exploring an alien ruin.

## Strategy

Coming from a random discovery from alien ruins, Alien Houses are some of the best houses in the game, even rivaling the Villa. It houses an impressive number of people, is quite cheap, and can easily get 100 quality if you get the Living Research Center upgrades. However, make sure you have adequate food production, as your citizens can easily fall to starvation if you build too much of these.
